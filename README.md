# cub3D
My first RayCaster with miniLibX

---

## Description

**cub3D** is a graphical programming project inspired by the iconic game **Wolfenstein 3D**, widely recognized as the first true First-Person Shooter (FPS).

The objective of this project is to create a **realistic 3D representation of a maze** using **ray-casting techniques**, rendered from a **first-person perspective**.  
The project is entirely written in **C** and uses the **miniLibX** graphical library.

This project focuses on:
- Ray-casting mathematics
- Basic 3D rendering concepts
- Texture mapping
- Event handling (keyboard and window events)
- Parsing and validating configuration files
